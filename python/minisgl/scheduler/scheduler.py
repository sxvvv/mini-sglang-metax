        ``send_result`` — one AbortAckMsg batch per tick keeps the wire
        ordering deterministic: any UserReply produced by this tick is
        flushed first, the acks follow.

        Invariants:
          * The list is cleared exactly when the acks are handed to
            ``send_result`` — so a second call on an empty list is a strict
            no-op, and a partial delivery (should ``send_result`` raise)
            leaves the acks unshipped for the next tick to retry.
          * Non-primary ranks share the same code path; ``send_result`` on
            those ranks is ``_reply_tokenizer_rank1`` which is a no-op. No
            rank-guard is needed here.
