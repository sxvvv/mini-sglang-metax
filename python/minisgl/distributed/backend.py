    Mapping::

        cpu  -> gloo

    On MetaX the ``cuda`` device selects the ``nccl`` backend, which the vendor
    ``torch.distributed`` implements against the MACA/MCCL stack.

    When ``device_type`` is ``None`` the function defers to
    :func:`minisgl.utils.device.get_device_type` (which itself is cached and
    side-effect free). When an explicit value is supplied the device layer is
    **not** re-probed — the caller's choice is honored verbatim.

    This helper is a pure lookup: it does not call
    ``torch.distributed.init_process_group``, does not touch any device or
    environment variable, and does not read rank/world-size state.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if ``device_type`` is not one of ``"cuda"``, ``"cpu"``.
